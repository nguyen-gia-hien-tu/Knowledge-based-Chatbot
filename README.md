# Knowlege-based Chatbot

Welcome to the knowledge-based chatbot application using the RAG pipeline ü§ñ

## End-to-End Steps to Setup the Chatbot


### Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and `record_manager_cache.db.example` to `record_manager_cache.db`

- Copy and Paste the file `.env.example` and rename the new file to `.env`

- Copy and Paste the file `record_manager_cache.db.example` and rename the new file to `record_manager_cache.db`

- We will modify the file `.env` to store API keys and configuration later on


### Create a Firebase Project

- Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

- Click on **"Create a project"** button to create a new Firebase project

- Enter the project name and click the **"Continue"** button

- After the project is created and you are in the project, click on the
  **"Settings"** icon (the ‚öôÔ∏è icon) and click on **"Project settings"**

- Then, navigate to the **"Service accounts"** tab and click **"Generate new
  private key"** button to create a new service account

- Then, name the file `firebase-service-account.json` and put it at the root of
  the repository (where you see the `src/` folder)

- Ensure that the values for both `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` in the `.env` file are
  `firebase-service-account.json`

- Now, on the same "Project settings" page, go to the **"General"** tab and
  locate the **"Web API Key"** entry

- Copy the value of this "Web API Key" and put it as the value for the
  **"FIREBASE_API_KEY"** in the `.env` file


### Create Storage in the Firebase project

- Inside the created Firebase project, choose the **"Storage"** service

- Click on **"Get started"** button to create a bucket

- Copy the bucket name, *excluding* the `gs://` part, but *including* the
  `.appspot.com` part and put it as the value of the
  `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` in the `.env` file


### Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID for Google Single-Sign On

- To enable "Log In with Google" feature, we need to enable **"Google"** in the
  "Sign-in providers" section

- Go to the created Firebase project and click on the **"Authentication"**
  product

- Then click on the **"Sign-in method"** tab and then, the **"Add new
  provider"** button

- Click on the **"Enable"** toggle to enable the Google provider

  - A drop down will appear to update "Public-facing name for project" and
    "Support email for project"

  - Enter a preferred name for the "Public-facing name for project"

  - Select the email address used to create the Firebase project for "Support
    email for project"

  - Then, click **"Save"**

- After Firebase finishes creating the client ID for "Sign in with Google"
  feature, go to the [Google Cloud
  Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page to
  download the client secret file

- In the Google Cloud Credentials page, there is a section for **"OAuth 2.0
  Client IDs"** with 1 entry. This entry is the client ID that we created above

- Click on the entry for client ID

- On the **"Client secrets"** section, there is a client secret shown along with
  a "Download JSON" button

- Click on the download button to download the file to the root of the
  repository with the name **"firebase-google-oidc-client-secret.json"**

- Make sure the value of the key `GOOGLE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` in the `.env`
  file has the value of `firebase-google-oidc-client-secret.json`, which is the
  name of the client secret file above

- Continue on this credentials page, locate the **"Authorized redirect URIs"**
  section

- Click on the **"Add URI"** button and enter **"http://localhost:8080"**, then
  press Enter

  - This is the URL with the port number where our Streamlit knowledge-based
    chatbot application locally runs on

  - When deploying to an actual hosting site, we will need to add that URL to
    the "Authorized redirect URIs" section

- Make sure the `GOOGLE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` in the `.env` file has the value of
  `http://localhost:8080` (for local development)

        ```

      - For Windows

        ```powershell
        .\.venv\Script\activate
        ```

    #### Run the application

    - Make sure you are at the root of the repository

    - Then run the application with

      ```bash
      streamlit run src/home.py --server.port 8080
      ```
  </details>

- To run the application with Docker, expand the below step

  <details>
